## Configuration

To use this MCP server with Claude Desktop:

1. Locate your Claude Desktop configuration file:
   - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   - Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
   - Linux: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

2. Add the following configuration to the file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "openfec": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/mcp-openfec/build/server.js"],
      "env": {
        "OPENFEC_API_KEY": "your_api_key_here"
      },
      "disabled": false,
      "autoApprove": []
    }
  }
}
```

Important configuration notes:
1. Replace `/absolute/path/to/mcp-openfec` with the actual path where you cloned the repository
2. Use absolute paths, not relative paths
3. Set `disabled` to `false` to enable the server
4. Keep `autoApprove` as an empty array for security
5. Add your OpenFEC API key in the `env` section
